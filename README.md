  - Customer trends.
  - Regional performance.
- Design interactive filters, slicers, and visuals to allow users to explore the data in different ways.

## Features

- **Sales Insights**: Track total sales, revenue, and profit margins across different regions and product categories.
- **Product Categories**: Understand the most popular product categories and their sales over time.
- **Customer Analysis**: Insights into customer demographics, purchasing patterns, and frequency of purchases.

- **Time Series Analysis**: Visualize how sales and customer behavior change over time, such as by month or week.
- **Interactive Filters**: Use slicers to filter data based on time, region, and product category.

## Technologies Used

- **Power BI**: For building the interactive dashboard.
- **Excel**: For data input, storing sales data.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: For creating calculated columns and measures to enhance data analysis.
